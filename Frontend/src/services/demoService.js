While regular computers use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use 'qubits' that can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This allows them to solve certain complex problems much faster, like drug discovery, encryption, and optimization challenges.",

  coding: [
    "Here's a Python function to sort a list:\n\n```python\ndef sort_list(items):\n    return sorted(items)\n\n# Example usage\nmy_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]\nsorted_list = sort_list(my_list)\nprint(sorted_list)  # [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]\n```\n\nThis uses Python's built-in `sorted()` function which implements an efficient Timsort algorithm.",

  productivity: [
    "Here are some innovative productivity app ideas:\n\n1. **FocusFlow** - An app that uses AI to block distractions only when you're struggling to concentrate\n2. **HabitStack** - Gamify habit building by unlocking new features as you maintain streaks\n3. **TimeSlice** - Auto-schedules breaks based on your actual fatigue levels (using device sensors)\n4. **TaskTunnel** - Turns task completion into an endless runner game where each task is an obstacle\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these?",

    "Latest AI News Summary:\n\n🚀 **Breakthrough Models**: New open-source models are achieving performance comparable to closed-source alternatives\n📱 **Edge AI**: More AI capabilities are moving to devices for privacy and speed\n🤖 **AI Agents**: Autonomous agents that can complete multi-step tasks are becoming mainstream\n⚖️ **Regulation**: New AI safety guidelines are being proposed globally\n🔬 **Research**: Significant progress in areas like reasoning, multimodal understanding, and efficiency\n\nWant me to dive deeper into any of these topics?",
